<div style="overflow:hidden;line-height:14pt">Meta-heuristic algorithms have gained remarkable success in solving complex and large-scale problems. However, as the dimension of the problem increases, their elaborate implementations may lead to lower convergence speed and struggle with local optima easily. Therefore, it is time-consuming for people to tune for high-dimensional problems. The focus of this article is to propose an improved GOA design method by a parallel communication strategy. The improved algorithm is vali- dated on widely used benchmark CEC-13 functions in 30-50 dimensions, compared to the original Gannet Optimization Algorithm (GOA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The outcomes of comprehensive experiments indicate that the parallel method indeed outperforms the compared algorithms in terms of better convergence value and shorter running time in solving high-dimensional problems.</div>
