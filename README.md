<div style="overflow:hidden;line-height:14pt">As the scale and dimension of problems increase, there is a need for people to solve them efficiently. Although there are many meta-heuristic algorithms aimed at solving these problems, complex implementations may lead to lower convergence speed and trapping in local optima. The focus of this study is to improve GOA using a parallel communication strategy. Aggressive optimization of the PGOA, 74% faster than the original GOA, and stunning 99% better performance! This study implies that the parallel communication strategy indeed can optimize the GOA efficiently and may be used to solve many large-scale and high-dimensional problems in the future.</div>
